# Final_Project
 I am proposing to make a device, which will alter the mood of a room by changing the color mode on WiFI enabled lights. The alteration is dependant on the users blood alcohol level. 

Summary
The main goal of this project is to connect to my lights without having to use my phone or any other device, focibly going low-fi. 


Component Parts
ADAFRUIT MICS5524 - Alcohol and VOC Gas Sensor 
Particle Photon 
Phillips Hue 
Micro USB 

Block Diagram

BAC (Blood alcohol concentration) # ===> BAC # SENT TO PHOTON ====> PHOTON COMMUNICATES WITH WIFI ===> LIGHTS COMMUNICATE WITH WIFI ===> LIGHTS RECEIVE COMMAND ===> LIGHTS REFLECT COMMAND BASED ON BAC 


Challenges

I generally dont know how to do any of this. 

Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks?

Week 1: Write proposal, borrow a PHOTON and just get the LED to work. 
Week 2: Acquire hardware components: Alcohol level, photon, Lights, and build a prototype circuit with those pieces.
Week 3: Build a first version of the code 
Week 4: Integrate all the components together and debug.
Week 5: Present complete project.
